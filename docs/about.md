### About the Name

So, why "Harvey"? Mostly because we liked it, but there are at least 3 other good reasons based on the origins of Plan 9 operating system:

1. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0042546/">Harvey</a> is a movie, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052077/">Plan 9</a> is a movie too.
1. Harvey is a rabbit, Glenda is a bunny.
1. Most importantly: in the movie, those who believed in Harvey were thought to be insane, but eventually found not to be.
