# Community

Our community is growing in members and interest.

Now Harvey has many people around its community, looking, experimenting,
testing... but in order to set main lines and goals, there is a bunch of people
in what we usually call "core team" making decisions, improving the system, testing
and resolving problems across all the source.
That doesn't mean you couldn't help us, through Github [pull-request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) method you can submit patches,
new programs or improvements that we will review and possibly accept. Every hand
is welcome.
